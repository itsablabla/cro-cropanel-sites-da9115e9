# Mega-menu choice overload — dev spec
Site: allbirds.com · Priority 5 · High · Effort: Low (0.5-2 days)

## Problem
The mega-menu presents 20+ nav items with multiple sub-levels, risking choice overload and decision paralysis for users.

## Evidence (from the live site)
> nav_items list contains 20 items including 'New Arrivals', 'Shop All', 'Bestsellers', 'LEATHER ALTERNATIVES', 'Men's Shoes', 'Sneakers', 'Slip Ons', 'Sandals', 'Active', 'All-Weather', 'Runner NZ', 'Cruiser', 'Tree Runner NZ', 'Socks', 'Men's Apparel', 'Women's Shoes', 'Trainers', 'Flats', 'Canvas Cruiser', 'Women's Apparel'.

## Current state
h1: Wildly Comfortable. Super Natural.; cta: SHOP MEN / SHOP WOMEN; notes: Mega-menu with 20+ items and multiple sub-levels (e.g., Men's Shoes > Sneakers, Slip Ons, Sandals, Active, All-Weather).

## Required change
h1: Wildly Comfortable. Super Natural.; cta: SHOP MEN / SHOP WOMEN; notes: Reduce top-level nav items to 5-7, consolidate sub-categories, and use clear labels to reduce cognitive load.
